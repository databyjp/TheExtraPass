### Sit alongside as a real Python-based data project is built

This is a data analytics project based on data from the National Basketball Association (NBA).
The project will look to ask and answer interesting questions about basketball, and tell the story through data, and visualisations.

But more than that, this project is about sharing the journey of a data project being built with Python. 

It is intended to show how a real, Python-based data analysis project is created from data gathering all the way to deployment.    

Articles will guide the reader **as the app is being built**. The articles will share thought process and the journey along the way in app building. The research done, what was learned, mistakes made, as well as the code at that point in time.

This way, the reader is along for the ride - as though they were shadowing the project. They will get an inside view of how the project is built from the start, why certain choices are made, and follow along as the project and code evolves and changes.
